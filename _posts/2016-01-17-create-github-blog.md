Github provide a very efficient worflow for you to host your blog on your own
domain (http://yoursite.yourdomain.com or http://username.github.io).

This howto describes in details how to set up a development environment
on [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) for you to edit and check your site
before publishing it on Github. If you are using a different OS, most of the
points are still useful.

This Howto can be decomposed in the following high level tasks

 * Install the required software in a Template VM
 * Create a VM to host the development environment
 * Install Jekyll
 * Setup Github pages
 * Setup Git
 * Create Jekyll site
 * Test site
 * Configure site
 * Publish site
 * Setup custom domain

We will install the development environment so that Fedora managed packages are
installed in a template VM (as they are signed) and the Ruby based packages are
installed in a `blog` development VM.

Background
----------

After reading [Joanna Rutkowska](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/about/)'s
[blog post with the same title](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/02/09/my-new-git-based-blog.html), I decide
to do the same and migrate my [Blogger site](http://bowabos.blogspot.co.uk/) to
what I suspect is the same toolchain. As I didn't know any of the tools used,
I took the oportunity to write this post to document the process.

Install the software
--------------------

Install the Ruby development package from a terminal window in your template VM

```bash
sudo yum install ruby-devel git
```

Create a blog VM
----------------

Create a new `Blue` (showing that it is a pretty safe environment as we'll be
the one generating files and the only interraction after set-up should be with
our Github repository), `blog` VM as documented in
[Qubes's getting started](https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started/)
page using the default Fedora template.

Install Jekyll
-------------

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a system which transforms your plain text
( [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) ) into
a static web site and blog. Markdown is an
[easy format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
to use.

Install the Jekyll package from a terminal window in our `blog` VM

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

Setup Github pages
------------------

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) allows you to host a website directly
from your [Github](https://github.com) repository: "Just edit, push, and your 
changes are live". We wll just add sign between the edit and the push as it is
essential that everybody start to sign what they produce so that our integrity
and privacy is respected.

Assuming your have a `username` Github account, please create via the Github web
site a new repository named `username.github.io`
 * Which is Public
 * With a .gitignore for Jekyll

Setup Git
---------

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) allows you to manage
source files and sign your commits.

Let's first follow the instructions in this previous Howto post:
[start with Git](/howto/2016/01/16/starting-with-git/), to setup your Git
environment.

Create Jekyll site
------------------

Let's first clone the repository we created on Github locally from a terminal
window in the 'blog' VM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

Let's now initialize the repository with a new Jekyll site

```bash
cd username.github.io
jekyll new . --force
```

Let's check the status of our local Git repository, stage the files (git add),
and commit the changes to our local repository

```bash
gs
ga .
gc -m "Initial Jekyll site commit"
```

Test site
---------

To preview our changes before publication we can use our local Jekyll
installation to generate the site and browse it locally.

Open a new terminal window in your `blog` VM

```bash
cd username.gihub.io
jekyll serve
```

Jekyll now serves your local development site locally (you just need to press
Ctrl+C to stop it). You can browse to it from firefox in the `blog` VM via
http://localhost:4000

Configure site
--------------

We are now going to edit the Jekyll `_config.yml` file to start personalize you
site

```yml
# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
title: My blog site
email: myEmail@mydomain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Blog covering QubesOS, personnal IT security and ho to provide services from your server to your home devices, with a very strong focus on security.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://username.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: yourTweeterAccount
github_username:  username

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
```

Jekyll usually picks up automatically changes made to local files with the
exception of this `_config.yml` file. Press Ctrl+C to stop the deamon are
restart it (this will not be required for different files updates).

Refresh your browser and "Voila".

Once you are happy with the changes, stage and commit them
```bash
gs
ga .
gc -m "Site configuration initialized"
```

Publish content
---------------

Now that you have tested and commited your changes we can publish them (git
push)

```bash
gp master
```

Setup custom domain
-------------------

Instead of hosting your site at https://username.github.io, you can setup a
custom domain such as https://yoursite.yourdomain.com by adding a `CNAME` file
(DNS alias) to your repository and to your DNS provider. The first to allow
Github to serve your site as a load balanced virtual domain and the second to
direct users to Github's server IPs.

```
yoursite.yourdomain.com
```

Let's publish this change:

```
ga .
gc -m "Adding custom domain"
gp
```

Finally, you will have to configure the CNAME with your DNS provider by
