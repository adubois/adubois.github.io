My name is Alex Dubois (pronounced: du - bowa). I am pationate about IT security
as well as a wide range of IT subjects and sciences.

Qubes OS
--------

At the moment I am contributing a little to [Qubes OS] which is a fantastic OS:

 * [Blog - Howto create a Github Blog]
 * [Blog - Howto start with Git]
 * [Code - Yubikey authentication][Qubes OS - Yubikey authentication]
 * [Blog - Howto set-up Jira and Confluence]
 * [Blog - Howto set-up DNSCrypt and Unbound]
 * [Documentation - firewall][Qubes OS - firewall]

Keyboard
--------

I am also building my own keyboard:

 * Design
 * CAD modelling
 * 3D Printing
 * Assembly and soldering
 * Controller programing

I have a working prototype with which I am currently typing which is quite
different from the keyboard you find both in term of shape and key's layout.
I may put some future blog post about it.

Work
----

I currently work for a French bank called [BNPParibas] were I am the technical
lead of a large team of developers and engineers. We architect and develop
internal products and services around identity and access management, SSO,
authentication, private cloud/automation as well as web hosting platforms.

I have been here for some time, but have been able to quench my IT knowledge
thirst by changing role internally every 2 to 3 years.

Before that, in 1997, I was working at [COMOTEC] in a team of 4 IT people.
2 managing AS400, myself managing 200 PCs for the various R&D departments
with the help of one person doing all the lifting. This is were I learnt a lot
about automation with no budget building a network between the 11 companies
(all based in the French Alps at the time), a central server managing the
softwares to automatically install from a bootable floppy any of the custom PCs
(migration from 95 to NT4 and Zero administration kit ;-) ). This is also when I
started to tinker with Linux on Slackware 3 ... the good old days.

I hope you'll enjoy these blog posts. Do not hesitate to drop me a line if you
thought a moment about it.
